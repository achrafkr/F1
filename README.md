## 1. About
This repository gathers a series of small projects around formula 1. The main focus is on data analysis and the design of AI algorithms for classification, clustering or prediction of the variables depending on the purpose of the project. 

The projects are divided into separate directories, and are mainly coded in python language. Each project consists of sequences of commented notebooks where the objectives and the analytical reports are presented in detail. Notebooks may be supported by python scripts for cases where code automation is required. 

Data comes from different sources, a specific folder with the data shall be created for each project. As a matter of consideration for the work done by the community and in order to simplify access to the data for future projects, all sources will be acknowledged and, whenever available, source links will be included.
However, some datasets are processed using multiple data sources. In such cases, sources will be disclosed in varying degrees of detail while reserving the choice to disclose the code used for processing (based on its relevance to the project). It will also be specified if the data used has been produced artificially.

## 2. Requirements
For the correct execution and reproducibility of the notebooks, we recommend the use of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) distribution system.

System requirements are generally basic and in specific cases where GPUs are used, it may be possible to run the project code using either the CPU or on a cloud environment in case the CPU becomes insufficient.

Libraries that are used are mentioned at the beginning of every notebook. Moreover, we recommend to install [FastF1](https://pypi.org/project/fastf1/) or [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/).

Also note that it will be useful to ensure the compatibility between certain releases of the libraries that are used in each project, with special attention on numpy and tensorflow.

## 3. Project Status
[Ongoing ...]

This is just the beginning and we will be extending the repository step by step.
